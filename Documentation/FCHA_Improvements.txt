Code quality
- Uniquify all managers
- Unit tests
- Organize files in filesystem (move by layers - data access, data structures, view models, dialogs, ...)
- Utilize Linq to sqlite
- Utilize WPF features to reduce code size
- Separate libraries for functionality
- Introduce UserControls

UI
- General dialogs (rather than speciffic ones for each data structure)
- Property sheets

Collections management
- Utilize observable collections
- Preserve selection and expanded nodes (for tree view)
- Don't update everything

User experrience
- Add hotkeys
- Introduce commands
- Check can be executed
- User input data validation
- Drag & Drop for categories editor
- Confirmation dialogs
- Edit in-place rather than open dialogs

Functionality
- User settings (key-value pairs)
- Database versioning
- Auto-complete based on e.g. categories list
- Auto complete based on statistical probability (MRU first)
- User commands (for most-frequent entries)
- Order categories

Specific features
- User setting - date change bound
- User setting - currency
- Expense category speciffication (from general to particular for existing expense)
- Global variables - e.g. date for inputting older expenses

Settings
- Database path
- MUI?

Graphics
- Icons

Code organization
- Move database code to Code from Data

Technical
- Migrate to the latest Visual Studio

Information
 - Static - e.g. currency list
 - Dynamic - e.g. rates
 - Informtaion security - don't commit personal database data; commit rather the SQL DML for the database

Processes
 - Account flows aggregation?


todo:
All viewModels should be unique in the process
factories for creating models
Introduce one place in code for all objects, objects' view models access (so that only one copy of each physical entity exists)

managers to cache viewmodels
nobody should manipultate plain data

UnderlyingData to be updated when accesed - in get accessor?

Expenses - update balance - aggregate flows

? What to do with deleted account's flows and expenses?
? Enforce update of cached entities?
? How do I get the id of just-added entity?


+ Task tracking

expenses filter - hierarchical categories


todo: remove from caches


group dates in OLAP - week, month, year

trees for olap filters, utilise Grid


AccountBalance -> AccountState

why caching? may be it is not useful since we load all items always?

todo: move categories or remove seqno

todo: triggers for deleting user or account - check accounts and expenses

todo: manage categories - one VM object should exist (currently - two - one in teh tree and one in the all list)

account can live without a person

todo: common classes for managers and viewmodels

todo: messagex instead of silent failures and returns

todo: change expense account - synch combobox

todo: sort and group expenses + filter

todo: date format validation

todo: test tricky cases when changing or removing account - what happens to expenses both in database and in view

expense sign - income???

todo: colors for amounts

todo: commands & commandmanager


user setting: domestic currency

creditcard state


MUI or russify

hierarchical requests for categories in olap

virtualization
asynchronization

olap building - add ordering and assume it - iterate over aggregated temptable data - each line is a cell in OLAP view

+ multidimensional


lastupdateddate must be consistent either always date or datetime

solid grid lines?

better refresh for olap view

enable/disable for buttons

! structure new thoughts

styles for add/change/remove buttons

for reporting - convert currencies

cashflows -> expenses

negate??

currency exchange

list of items to buy
task tracker


http://stackoverflow.com/questions/172735/create-use-user-defined-functions-in-system-data-sqlite


Flow = 2 expenses

Function for sqlite for setting drill down level for categories?

Not necessary to use udfs.
Just use selected category as root.


System.EntryPointNotFoundException crossed a native/managed boundary
?


Error handling


git mv *ViewModel.cs ViewModels/


Icons for categories? Allow user to select them. Carry a base of icons. Separately from sqlite?


todo: indexes for tables


Drag & Drop

user controls
