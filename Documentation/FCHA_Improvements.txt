Code quality
- Uniquify all managers
- Unit tests
- Organize files in filesystem (move by layers - data access, data structures, view models, dialogs, ...)
- Utilize Linq to sqlite
- Utilize WPF features to reduce code size
- Separate libraries for functionality
- Introduce UserControls

UI
- General dialogs (rather than speciffic ones for each data structure)
- Property sheets

Collections management
- Utilize observable collections
- Preserve selection and expanded nodes (for tree view)
- Don't update everything

User experrience
- Add hotkeys
- Introduce commands
- Check can be executed
- User input data validation
- Drag & Drop for categories editor
- Confirmation dialogs
- Edit in-place rather than open dialogs

Functionality
- User settings (key-value pairs)
- Database versioning
- Auto-complete based on e.g. categories list
- Auto complete based on statistical probability (MRU first)
- User commands (for most-frequent entries)
- Order categories

Specific features
- User setting - date change bound
- User setting - currency
- Expense category speciffication (from general to particular for existing expense)
- Global variables - e.g. date for inputting older expenses

Settings
- Database path
- MUI?

Graphics
- Icons

Code organization
- Move database code to Code from Data

Technical
- Migrate to the latest Visual Studio

Information
 - Static - e.g. currency list
 - Dynamic - e.g. rates
 - Informtaion security - don't commit personal database data; commit rather the SQL DML for the database

Processes
 - Account flows aggregation?


todo:
All viewModels should be unique in the process
factories for creating models
Introduce one place in code for all objects, objects' view models access (so that only one copy of each physical entity exists)

managers to cache viewmodels
nobody should manipultate plain data

UnderlyingData to be updated when accesed - in get accessor?

Expenses - update balance - aggregate flows

? What to do with deleted account's flows and expenses?
? Enforce update of cached entities?
? How do I get the id of just-added entity?


+ Task tracking

expenses filter - hierarchical categories
